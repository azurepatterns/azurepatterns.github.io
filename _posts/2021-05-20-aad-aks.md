  We'll setup a basic AAD enabled cluster and ensure we can access everything via the portal.

Do you want to enable Azure AD integration with your Azure Kubernetes Service
(AKS) but struggle with 403 Forbidden error messages in the Azure portal
when trying to view Kubernetes objects?  If you're having these issues this
could be a good post for you.  We'll look at what causes this and 3 solutions to
fix it.

## Problem
Recently I've been on a couple of calls where AKS users were baffled by how to
browse AKS objects via the Azure Portal once AAD integration was enabled.  In this post we'll walk through
setting up a VERY basic cluster and enabling AAD integration.

First, things first let's get a basic Kubernetes cluster created with AAD
integration enabled.  In this example we aren't going to explore any specific settings
in AKS besides the AAD integration bits so if you are looking for specific
configurations for AKS you'll want to check out the [AKS Best
Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/best-practices).

```terminal
>> az group create -n MyExampleRG -l eastus
>> az aks create -g MyExampleRG -n MyAKSCluster --enable-aad
```

We now have an AKS cluster names MyAKSCluster that has been integrated with
Azure AD.  Right away if you try to view this cluster in the AKS portal you'll
see some limitations on what you can see inside the cluster even though you
created it!

Additionally, if we pull the credentials of this cluster
with __az__ to use with __kubectl__ you'll see that we don't have access to view
anything via kubectl either.  

```terminal
>> az aks get-credentials -n MyAKSCluster -g MyExampleRg
Merged "MyAKSCluster" as current context in /Users/bmcconnell/.kube/config


>> kubectl get nodes
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code FGDNP2KLS to authenticate.
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "user@microsoft.com" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope

```

On the positive side you can already see that Azure AD is getting invoked since
we are being directed to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin to get access to
AKS.

## Solution

Now that we've got a well defined problem... Let's fix it...

### Solution #1 - Create Cluster with --aad-admin-group-object-ids
The easiest way to fix this would be to have not gotten into this situation at
all by specifying an AAD group when we created the cluster. As long as we were a
member of that group we would have access to Kubernetes objects in the portal.

```terminal
>> az ad group list --filter "displayname eq 'myAKSAdminGroup'" -o table

DisplayName      MailEnabled    MailNickname     ObjectId                            
---------------  -------------  ---------------  ------------------------------------
myAKSAdminGroup  False          myAKSAdminGroup  9943dc8b-3911-4eab-af34-8b61ac667714

>> az aks create -g MyExampleRG -n MyAKSCluster --enable-aad \
>>   --aad-admin-group-object-ids 9943dc8b-3911-4eab-af34-8b61ac667714
```

Now if we check out our cluster in the portal we'll see the ojbects in
Kubernetes.

### Solution #2 - Update the Cluster with --aad-admin-group-object-ids
So now we'll assume that you've already created your cluster and either don't
want to start again or can't.  You can update existing clusters to enable AAD
with __az aks update__

```terminal
>> az aks update -n myManagedCluster2 -g MyExampleRg \
>>   --aad-admin-group-object-ids 9943dc8b-3911-4eab-af34-8b61ac66771

```
This can also be updated via the Azure portal by browsing to the AKS cluster
object and selecting __Cluster configuration__ from the left navigation menu and
adding the correct Azure AD Group for __Admin Azure AD groups__

### Solution #3 - Add ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to AKS Cluster
If we scratch a little deeper into what's going on in AKS when we enable
AAD integration we'll find that a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding is being
created when we use --aad-admin-group-object-ids.  For instance if we use
__kubectl__ to investigate we'll find a clusterrolebinding called
__aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad__

```terminal
kubectl describe clusterrolebinding aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad
Name:         aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad
Labels:       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode=Reconcile
              kubernetes.io/cluster-service=true
Annotations:  <none>
Role:
  Kind:  ClusterRole
  Name:  cluster-admin
Subjects:
  Kind   Name                                  Namespace
  ----   ----                                  ---------
  Group  9943dc8b-3911-4eab-af34-8b61ac667714
```
One thing you may have noticed is that there is no equivalent flag on __az aks
create__ to enable access to user objects... only group objects.  So if you are
in a situation where you are creating a personal cluster and don't want to
enable group access, you can still use AAD integration but you'll need to add
your own clusterrolebinding.

If we don't want to give an entire group access via AAD we can add a
clusterrolebinding to our cluster that will provide access to a particular user.

```terminal
>> cat aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad-user.yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: user@microsoft.com

>> kubectl apply -f aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad-user.yaml
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad-user created
```

So the above clusterrolebinding is referencing an existing clusterrole in AKS
called cluster-admin.  This role provides access to all resources cluster wide.

```terminal
kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
Name:         cluster-admin
Labels:       kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
Annotations:  rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: true
PolicyRule:
  Resources  Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------  -----------------  --------------  -----
  *.*        []                 []              [*]
             [*]                []              [*]
```
Now at this point the user defined in the
aks-cluster-admin-binding-aad-user.yaml file above will have access to view
the Kubernetes resources in the Azure portal.
